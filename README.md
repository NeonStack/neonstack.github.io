# My Online Portfolio

Welcome to my online portfolio! As a third-year student passionate about technology, this portfolio showcases my journey in web development, research, and continuous learning. While I'm particularly drawn to web development, I'm also exploring other areas to stay flexible in a rapidly evolving tech landscape.

## About Me

I'm a third-year student with a strong interest in web development and a growing curiosity about AI. Though I’m still learning, my portfolio highlights the skills I've developed, the projects I've worked on, and the training I've undertaken. I’m eager to continue expanding my knowledge and taking on new challenges.

## Featured Project: GO FOR IT

"GO FOR IT" is an internship job platform designed to connect students with internship opportunities. Developed as part of a research project, this system is built with PHP and is designed to function similarly to job platforms like Indeed, but specifically for internships. This project represents my ability to take on both the technical and research aspects of software development.
